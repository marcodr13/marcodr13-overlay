1. Create a MySQL database if you haven't already one.
2. Navigate to your gallery. Example: if you uploaded in a subfolder named
   "zenphoto" navigate to www.yoursite.org/zenphoto/. Setup.php will run. (If
   it somehow does not, please navigate directly to 
   www.yoursite.org/zenphoto/zp-core/setup.php)
3. Enter the MySQL credentials and make sure everything checks out.
4. Then click GO!
5. ENJOY!
